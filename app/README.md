# ToungeMotherize
[ToungeMotherize](C:\Users\SCC\AndroidStudioProjects\ToungeMotherize\app\src\main\java\com\example\toungemotherize\MainActivity.java) is an android translate app.

Translation was realized using Firebase tool from google.

[`Design`](C:\Users\SCC\AndroidStudioProjects\ToungeMotherize\app\src\main\res\layout\activity_main.xml) was obviously inspired by the google translate graphical interface.
